Welcome to the Bike Fix Sundays website.
It was set up to help document community bike repair projects. 
The 'Sunday' in the name does not mean we only fix bikes on Sundays, but emphasises the focus on volunteer-led local community projects such as [Sunday Service](ls7) (which often but not always open on a Sunday), rather than professional bike shops.

<!-- A list of bike repair projects is shown below (if want to add another project see here to edit or download the data). -->

<!-- projects = tibble::tribble( -->
<!--   ~project_name, ~project_address, ~lon, ~lat, ~opening_hours, ~website, ~open_since -->
