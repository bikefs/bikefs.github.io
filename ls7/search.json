We cannot fix major repairs but we\ncan provide advice and help diagnose problems. The focus is on helping\nyou to fix your own bike and giving you the skills to fix your bike, and\nhelp others, in the future.\nGet in touch with any questions or if you’d like to help by donating\nparts, tools or volunteer time by emailing us at sundayservicels7@gmail.com.\nIf you would like to fix your bike you can book it in by filling in\nour booking form here.\nWe ask that you fill in the form before bringing your bike although\nanyone is more than welcome to pass by to say hi while we’re working on\nbikes.\n\n\n\n",
