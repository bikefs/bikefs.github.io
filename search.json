      "contents": "\nBike Fix Sundays is a community bicycle repair project. It grew out of informal bike repair sessions that have variously been called ‘bike repair Sundays’, ‘bike fix Sundays’ and just ‘fixing bikes on the street’, which is in essence what it’s about: people who have tools and knowhow getting bikes in need of some attention back on the road to help people in the local community.\nThe name Bike Fix Sundays was coined after the concept was formalised. A local charity in Leeds provided space for regular bike repair activities (every Sunday), a meeting was organised, and Bike Fix Sundays was the name that stuck.\nSunday service isn’t about doing major bike repairs. It’s about providing space and time for people to learn how to service and make minor repairs to their own bike. The first Bike Fix Sundays sessions in Leeds ran 2pm to 5pm on Sundays and were attended by 2 people with experience fixing bikes and 5-10 people who wanted to fix their bikes or learn bike repair skills.\nAlthough the project started in Leeds, inspired by the Pedallers Arms cooperative project and with support from the Latch community housing charity, the concept can work anywhere. All you need to make a Bike Fix Sundays event happen near your are:\nPeople who need to service or make minor repairs to their bike\nPeople with basic bike fixing knowledge\nBasic tools and components (e.g. puncture repair kit, bike pump)\nA safe space to work\nThat’s it. A person fixing their own bike on the street in a public space could be a Sunday service. You don’t even need to do it on a Sunday!\nTaking some steps to formalise the idea as a regular event can help it grow and benefit more people, which is what this website is about.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nWelcome to the Bike Fix Sundays website. It was set up to help document community bike repair projects. The ‘Sunday’ in the name does not mean we only fix bikes on Sundays, but emphasises the focus on volunteer-led local community projects such as Sunday Service (which often but not always open on a Sunday), rather than professional bike shops.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee the about page for more info.\n\n\n\n",
