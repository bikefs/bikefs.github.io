      "contents": "\nBike Fix Sundays is a community bicycle repair project. It grew out\nof informal bike repair sessions that have variously been called ‘bike\nrepair Sundays’, ‘bike fix Sundays’ and just ‘fixing bikes on the\nstreet’, which is in essence what it’s about: people who have tools and\nknowhow getting bikes in need of some attention back on the road to help\npeople in the local community.\nThe name Bike Fix Sundays was coined after the concept was\nformalised. A local charity in Leeds provided space for regular bike\nrepair activities (every Sunday), a meeting was organised, and Bike Fix\nSundays was the name that stuck.\nSunday service isn’t about doing major bike repairs. It’s about\nproviding space and time for people to learn how to service and make\nminor repairs to their own bike. The first Bike Fix Sundays sessions in\nLeeds ran 2pm to 5pm on Sundays and were attended by 2 people with\nexperience fixing bikes and 5-10 people who wanted to fix their bikes or\nlearn bike repair skills.\nAlthough the project started in Leeds, inspired by the Pedallers Arms cooperative\nproject and with support from the Latch community housing charity,\nthe concept can work anywhere. All you need to make a Bike Fix Sundays\nevent happen near your are:\nPeople who need to service or make minor repairs to their bike\nPeople with basic bike fixing knowledge\nBasic tools and components (e.g. puncture repair kit, bike\npump)\nA safe space to work\nThat’s it. A person fixing their own bike on the street in a public\nspace could be a Sunday service. You don’t even need to do it on a\nSunday!\nTaking some steps to formalise the idea as a regular event can help\nit grow and benefit more people, which is what this website is\nabout.\n\n\n\n",

The ‘Sunday’ in the name does\nnot mean we only fix bikes on Sundays, but emphasises the focus on\nvolunteer-led local community projects such as Sunday\nService (which often but not always open on a Sunday), rather than\nprofessional bike shops.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee the about page for more info.\n\n\n\n",
